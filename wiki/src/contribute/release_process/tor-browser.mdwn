[[!meta title="Releasing the Tor Browser"]]

[[!toc levels=1]]

Have a look at

* http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/
* http://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/
* http://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/builds/
* http://people.torproject.org/~linus/builds/

and see if the desired version is available. We prefer
`archive.torproject.org` since the other sources periodically cleans
up old releases.

Fetch the version's `sha256sums.txt` and `sha256sums.txt.asc`, verify
with `gpg`, and:

    grep "\<tor-browser-linux32-.*\.tar.xz$" sha256sums.txt > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-sha256sums.txt

to make the checksums available at build time, when the tarballs are
fetched. Then update the url to the one chosen above:

    echo "http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/" > \
         config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/tails/tbb-dist-url.txt

NOTE: We must use http (not http**s**) due to limitations/bugs in
`apt-cacher-ng`, which often is used in Tails build
environments. However, it is of no consequence since we verify the
checksum file.
