* 2014-10-14: Release Tails 1.2. anonym is RM.

* 2014-11-25: Release 1.2.1. anonym is RM.

* 2015-01-06: Release 1.2.2. anonym is RM. If Mozilla decides to send
  their employees on vacation, delaying the Firefox ESR release for a
  week or two, anonym can still be RM.

* 2015-02-17: Release 1.3. Still undecided who will be RM, but anonym
  probably can do it.
