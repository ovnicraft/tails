# Broken windows 
We looked at the [[broken windows|https://labs.riseup.net/code/versions/198]]
Many build environment related tasks.
Maybe a friend of someone wants to look on Docker issues

# Monthly low-hanging fruit sessions
Next one is on Friday, September 12, on #tails-dev (indymedia.org) at 19:00 UTC (21:00 CEST)

# [[Tails Code of Conduct|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-project/2014-August/000013.html]]
Everybody likes the way is shaping, altough we need to cover more situations.
Someone will write a blueprint, and send an email with the updated version

# [[!tails_ticket 7870]]: Include OnionShare in Tails? - Tails
We will wait until it is included in Debian
Meanwhile someone will have a look at the code and someone else will update the redmine tickets

#[[!tails_ticket 7540]] There should be more darknets installed, for example freenet and Namecoin.
We don't know Namecoin, and adding freenet seems a bad idea to someone. Also they are not in Debian.
We will close the ticket and open another one in case some darknet packaged for Debian appears (freenet, namecoin or others)

# [[!tails_ticket 7753]] Decide what to do regarding OFTC
We see indymedia and oftc as unstable services. We need something more stable to have preconfigured in Tails.
We lack of time and resources to run our own irc server.
Maybe  XMPP is a better solution
Someone will investigate solutions for the situation on [[!tails_ticket 7874]]
