[[!meta title="Translate Tails into French"]]

**For French**, the existing translators team uses Git.
Please first read the documentation about [[translating with Git|translate/translate_with_git]].

## What can be translated

For french, various bits of text can be translated via Git:

* **Custom programs**: each one has its own Git repository, where PO files live in the `po` directory.
Some have a `README.translators` at the root of their source tree: please read it.

	Here is a list of these repositories:
	[Tails Greeter](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/greeter),
	[Tails Persistence Setup](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/persistence-setup),
	[Tails  Installer](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/liveusb-creator),
	[Tails Upgrader](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/iuk),
	[Tails Perl library](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/perl5lib)
	and [WhisperBack](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/whisperback).

* **A set of various translatable strings** live in the `po`
  directory, in [  branch of the main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/log/?h=devel).

* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch of the
  [main Tails Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/).

## Contributors' repositories

## Glossaries used by the french team

A [french glossary](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/glossary/l/fr/)
is [host by the Tor Project on Transifex](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/introducing-tor-translation-glossary).

See also [amaGama](https://amagama-live.translatehouse.org/),
which aims to "gather FOSS translations together in one place".

## Team duties

Our custom programs can be translated [[using
Transifex|translate/translate_with_transifex]]. Work done there is not automatically
synchronized with the translations your team does in Git.

It is nice to minimize time wasted by unknown people who work, with
Transifex, on the same thing as your translation team.

So, a translation team using Git should regularly contact Transifex
translators (listed in the `Last-translator` field of the PO files one
can download from Transifex), either over email or using the Transifex
interface, to:

1. Thank them for translating Tails stuff.
2. Make it clear their work is not imported (and is therefore, well,
   useless).
3. Invite them to join the team and share the team's
   preferred workflow.
4. Invite them to subscribe to [[the mailing list for
   translators|translate#follow-up]].
