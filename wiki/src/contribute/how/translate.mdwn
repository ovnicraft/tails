# For native English speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're
more than welcome to correct or improve our English.
For this, you can either follow the [[Git workflow|translate/translate_with_git]] or
[[propose|contribute/talk]] another way that suits you better to share
your improvements with us.

# Translate Tails custom programs

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Tails
programs and documentation into your native language:

* **For French**, the existing translation
  team uses Git. So, read [[translating with Git|translate/translate_with_git]].
* **For other languages**, read [[translating with
  Transifex|translate/translate_with_transifex]].
  Currently, Tails programs can be translated into 149 languages this way.

# Translate this website

You can also translate our documentation, that is, this website.
The website is [[translated with Git|translate/translate_with_git]].

The translations are peer-reviewed and thus, you need to get into contact with
a language team if you want to participate.
In general, you can contact the translation teams via the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

<a id="language-teams"></a>

Currently, there are three active **language teams**:

* [[french|translate/language_team_fr]]
* [[german|translate/language_team_de]]
* [[brazilian portuguese|translate/language_team_pt-br]]

and three new language teams who need more contributors:

* italian
* spanish
* turkish

If your language is not listed here, you may want to read the documentation
to [[add a new language|translate/add_new_language]].

# Mailing list for translators

Translators coordinate on the tails-l10n mailing list (*l10n* stands
for [[!wikipedia Software_localization desc="localization"]]).

Please <a href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a [public
archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/), so beware of
what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, email subject and content, etc.

# Follow-up on translation needs

Important changes to translatable strings are announced on the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].
