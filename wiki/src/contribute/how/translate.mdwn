# For native English speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're
more than welcome to correct or improve our English.
For this, you can either follow the [[Git workflow|translate/translate_with_git]] or
[[propose|contribute/talk]] another way that suits you better to share
your improvements with us.

# Translate Tails

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Tails
programs and documentation into your native language:

* **For French**, the existing translation
  team uses Git. So, read [[translating with Git|translate/translate_with_git]].
* **For other languages**, read [[translating with
  Transifex|translate/translate_with_transifex]].

Currently, Tails programs can be translated into 149 languages this way.

# Translate this website

You can also translate our documentation, that is, this website.

The translations are peer-reviewed and thus, you need to get into contact with
a language team if you want to participate.

Currently, there are three active language teams:
* [[french|translate/language_team_fr]]
* [[german|translate/language_team_de]]
* portuguese

and three new language teams who need more contributors:
* italian
* spanish
* turkish

In general, you can contact the translation teams via the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

The website is [[translated with Git|translate/translate_with_git]].

# Translate this website into a new language

There are already some active website translation teams,
coordinating via the [[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

So, you want the Tails website to be available in a new language.
Please keep in mind that it represents quite a lot of work.

Therefore, here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating the Tails website to a new language:

1. A team of translators, not just one person, is necessary. That also
   allows for peer reviews between the team, more flexibility for
   example when an important deadline arrives.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[mailing list
   for translators|translate#follow-up]].

3. Since the content of the website is sensitive in terms of privacy
   protection, Tails developers need to establish contacts with
   trusted people to review the work from time to time.

4. For translations to be useful, they need to be maintained in the
   long run. This takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations.

  - Important parts of our website:

    - [[/index]]
    - [[/about]] page
    - [[/getting_started]] page
    - [[/support]] page
    - [[/download]] page

# Follow-up on translation needs

Translators coordinate on the tails-l10n mailing list (*l10n* stands
for [[!wikipedia Software_localization desc="localization"]]).
Important changes to translatable strings are announced there.

Please <a href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a [public
archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/), so beware of
what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, email subject and content, etc.

You can consult this
[archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/) to search
for recent translation requests.
