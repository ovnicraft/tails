Tails
[Hackfest](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/) that
happened on July 5-6 in Paris was a great time: about 120 people
attended on Saturday, 70 people on Sunday. We shared some very good
food, workshops and beer in a nice and friendly atmosphere.

The slides of some talks are already
[published](https://tails.boum.org/promote/slides/), but there are
even more to come!

The first Tails stickers were distributed and you can also make your
own! Just use [these](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7011) SVG
files.

We are particularly happy that the Hackfest attracted very different
people, so we were a quite diverse assembly. Probably thanks to our
[anti-harassment
policy](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/policy/)
(thanks Genma for the frensh translation)...

Some people talked about the hackfest:

(please send links!)

Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/) and

course, all our fabulous attendees that made the event so interesting
and nice!
