**Corresponding ticket**: [[!tails_ticket 7036]]

A few teams, such as the debian-installer and Debian Perl ones, that
use many Git repositories (thousands, in case of the latter), have
been successfully using mr to make an initial checkout easier for new
contributors, and generally making it easier to deal with a lot of
repositories (mass-update, etc.). We could do the same, starting with
maintaining and publishing a .mrconfig file.

Additional custom repositories we use and may want to include in this
.mrconfig: whisperback, htp, tails-greeter, etc.

OTOH, Git submodules allow to do basically the same thing, but also to
make it clear what version of these other repositories a given Git
branch (in the main repo) needs.
