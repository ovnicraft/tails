# Introduction

Our [[documentation|doc/first_steps/startup_options/windows_camouflage]] reads "If
you are using a computer in public you may want to avoid attracting unwanted
attention by changing the way Tails looks into something that resembles
Microsoft Windows 8." This is what we call "Windows camouflage".

Windows camouflage is {[broken in Debian Jessie based Tails|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8064]]. This blueprint
describes what should be done to update Windows Camouflage for Jessie.

# Goals/Non-Goals

The goal of Windows camouflage is to "avoid attracting unwanted attention" when
"using a computer in public". To achieve this goal, the display of a Tails
system with Windows camouflage should look similar to the display of a computer
running a common operating system such as Microsoft Windows for a person seeing
the computer from a few meters.

The goal of Windows camouflage is **not** to look exactly like Microsoft
Windows. E.g. it is acceptable for the icons not to be exactly the same.

The goal of Windows camouflage update is **not** to cover more versions of
windows not to implement OS X camouflage. This would be nice bonuses thought.

# Requirements

Windows camouflage update MUST include:

- a Gtk 3 theme that looks like Windows 8.1 desktop interface compatible with
  the version of Gtk 3 shipped in Debian Jessie (3.14.5)
- a Gtk 2 theme that looks like Windows 8.1 desktop interface compatible with
  the version of Gtk 2 shipped in Debian Jessie (2.24.25)
- a Mutter/Metacity theme that looks like Windows 8.1 desktop compatible with
  the version of Mutter shipped in Debian Jessie (3.14.2)
- an icon theme that looks like Windows 8.1 desktop icons compatible with the version
  of GNOME shipped in Debian Jessie (3.14.2) and including all icons that might
  be displayed on the Tails desktop at startup.
- a GNOME Shell theme/extension that looks like Windows 8.1 desktop panel compatible with
  the version on GNOME Shell shipped in Debian Jessie (3.14.2)
- a way to enable all the required components to provide the camouflage mode
  that can be triggered by [[Tails Greeter|https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/index.en.html#index2h1]]

Windows camouflage MAY include:

- a GNOME Shell theme/extension that make GNOME Shell activity view look like
  Windows 8.1 start screen, compatible with the version on GNOME Shell shipped
  in Debian Jessie (3.14.2)

# Implementation

## Pieces needing update

- [[gnome-theme-windows8|http://git.tails.boum.org/gnome-theme-windows8/]] which
  should mostly need update. It contains:
  - an icon theme based on [[Gnomeight GNOME Icon Theme by Ambiance
    69|http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=163560]]
  - a Gtk 2 and 3 theme based on [[Windows 8 modern UI (metro) Gtk3 (+Gtk2) by Maxime
    D.|http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=158721]]
  - [[Windows 8 modern UI (metro) Metacity Theme by Maxime D.|http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=157024]]
  - [[Windows 8 cursors by David Farkas|http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=155025]]
- activation scripts, one [[run as
  root|http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/tails-prepare-win8-theme]]
and one run [[in the GNOME session|http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-activate-win8-theme]] which should mostly need update. They are [[trggered by the greeter|http://git.tails.boum.org/greeter/tree/PostLogin.default]]

## Pieces to drop

- [[GNOME Panel's Window Picker
  Applet|http://git.tails.boum.org/gnome-panel-applet-window-picker/]] which
should not be used anymore as Debian Jessie based Tails don't use GNOME Panel
anymore.

## Missing pieces

The biggest and most exciting task is probably to implement the missing part of
the puzzle which is an GNOME Shell theme/extension that mimic Windows 8.1
desktop.  I's probably about writing a custom shell theme and/or extension, inspired by
GNOME's "classic" set of extensions.

Ressources:

- the GNOME Shell's "Classic" set of extensions: [[windows
  list|https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/extensions/window-list]];
[[apps-menu|https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/extensions/apps-menu]]
and [[places-menu|https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/extensions/places-menu]]
- a [[relevant cinnamon theme|http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/188]]
