## LDTP

LDTP is an open source testing tool that uses computer assistive
technology (accessibility) to automate GUIs. It's used by GNOME,
Mozilla and others:

* [[!wikipedia Linux_Desktop_Testing_Project]]
* [homepage](http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
* [tutorial](http://download.freedesktop.org/ldtp/doc/ldtp-tutorial.pdf)
* The main bindings are Python, but there also are a Ruby client and
  Perl bindings in the [Git repo](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ldtp/ldtp2/tree/ldtp)
* The LDTP dev mailing-list is very quiet, and it's unclear whether
  GNOME still uses it, or instead switched to dogtail.

# Open questions

## Using accessibility technologies?

In some cases, it could simplify some testing steps, such as anything
about navigating menus, that we're currently mostly avoiding since
it's hard to do in a robust way with Sikuli.

A downside is that we're not exactly testing how most users interact
with the software. Some upsides are that it would ensure that our
stuff does support accessibility technologies, and that we would have
to maintain less pictures.
