[[!tag security/current]]

A security hole affects I2P 0.9.13, that is part of Tails 1.1
and earlier.

Scope and severity
==================

If you are [[using I2P|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p]] in Tails 1.1 and
earlier, an attacker can de-anonymize you: they can learn the IP
address that identifies you on the Internet.

To be able to conduct this attack:

1. the attacker must be able to affect the content of a website that
   you are visiting using the [[Tor
   Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser]] in Tails; in most
   cases, this includes a large amount of people;

2. and, the attacker must know the details of this security hole; as
   far as we know, this information has not been published yet, but
   your adversaries may somehow have found about it already.

<div class="note">

<p><strong>Tails does not start I2P by default.</strong></p>

<p>One of the [[reasons|contribute/design/I2P#design]] for this is
precisely to protect Tails users who do not use I2P from this kind of
problems.</p>

<p>Still, an attacker who would be able to exploit another,
undisclosed security hole allowing them to run arbitrary programs as
the `amnesia` user on your Tails, can very well start I2P, and then
use the I2P security hole to de-anonymize you. To be able to do so,
they also have to satisfy the requirements listed above.</p>

</div>

Temporary solutions
===================

You can protect yourself from this security hole until it
is corrected.

Either, do not start I2P in Tails 1.1 and earlier. Wait for us to
announce a security update.

Or, if you need to use I2P: every time you start I2P, disable
JavaScript globally [[with
NoScript|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#noscript]] in the
Tor Browser.
