Security considerations
=======================

Although *TrueCrypt* looks like free software, [concerns](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) over
[its licence](http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license) prevent its inclusion in Debian.
Truecrypt is also *developed* in a closed
fashion, so while the source code is freely available,
it may receive less review than might a comparable openly developed project.

Lastly, on 28 May 2014, the [*TrueCrypt* website](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) announced that the
project was no longer maintained and recommended users to find
alternate solutions. That website now reads:

> WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues.

For the above reasons, we recommend that you use [[LUKS encrypted
volumes|/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] instead of *TrueCrypt*
volumes.

Still, you can open *TrueCrypt* volumes in Tails, either:

 * [[with `cryptsetup`|truecrypt#cryptsetup]], which is here to stay;
 * [[with *TrueCrypt*|truecrypt#truecrypt]], that will be removed in
   Tails 1.2.1 (November 25).

Opening *TrueCrypt* volumes using `cryptsetup`
==============================================

`cryptsetup` allows one to open most existing *TrueCrypt* volumes.
Both standard and hidden *TrueCrypt* volumes are supported.

This technique uses the command line.

1. [[Set up an administration
   password|startup_options/administration_password]].

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span>
   to open a terminal with administration rights.

1. **If you want to open a standard *TrueCrypt* volume**, execute the
   following command, replacing `[device]` with the name of the device
   found in the previous step, and `[name]` with a mapping name of
   your choice.

       cryptsetup open --type tcrypt [device] [name]
   
   Here is an example of the command to execute, yours is probably
   different:

       cryptsetup open --type tcrypt /dev/sdc1 truecrypt1

   **Else, if you want to open a hidden *TrueCrypt* volume**, execute
   the following command, replacing `[device]` with the name of the
   device found in the previous step, and `[name]` with a mapping name
   of your choice.

       cryptsetup --tcrypt-hidden open --type tcrypt [device] [name]
   
   Here is an example of the command to execute, yours is probably
   different:

       cryptsetup --tcrypt-hidden open --type tcrypt /dev/sdc2 truecrypt2

1. Once the command prompt reappears, execute the following commands,
   replacing `[name]`with the mapping name chosen above.

       mkdir /mnt/[name]
       mount /dev/mapper/[name] /mnt/[name]

1. If you don't see any error message, the data stored in your
   TrueCrypt volume is now available in the `/mnt/[name]` directory.
   
   Depending on the kind of filesystem being used, you might need
   administration rights to modify the content of this directory.
   A better solution is generally to adjust the `mount` command above:
   for instance, if this is a `vfat` filesystem, then you may want to
   use the `uid=` mount option; see the `mount` manpage for details.

1. To ensure that your data was really written on your *TrueCrypt*
   volume, once you don't need it during this Tails session, execute
   the following commands, replacing `[name]`with the mapping name
   chosen above.

       umount /mnt/[name]
       cryptsetup close [name]

Starting *TrueCrypt*
====================

<div class="note">

<p><em>TrueCrypt</em> will be removed in Tails 1.2.1 (November 25).
We recommend that you learn how to [[open <emph>TrueCrypt</emph> volumes with
<code>cryptsetup</code>|truecrypt#cryptsetup]] as soon as possible.</p>

</div>

*TrueCrypt* is not enabled by default when Tails starts. In order to use
*TrueCrypt*, add the <span class="command">truecrypt</span> boot option
to the <span class="application">boot menu</span>. For detailed
instructions, see the documentation on [[using the <span
class="application">boot
menu</span>|first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

Once Tails has started, to start <span
class="application">TrueCrypt</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">TrueCrypt</span></span>.
